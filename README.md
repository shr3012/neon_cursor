## Features 

- **Real-time mouse tracking:** The trail follows the mouse in real-time as it moves across the screen.
- **Smooth fading effect:** The trail smoothly fades away as the mouse continues to move, creating a visually appealing animation.
- **Customizable:** You can easily modify the trail length, color, and fading effect.
